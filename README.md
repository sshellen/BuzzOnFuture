# Buzz On The Future

This is a visualization created using a dataset made available by the World Government Summit.

The idea behind this dashboard is to show the popularity of popular topics by referencing their respective google search results.

Most topics have relevance in the present day as well as 'buzz' about their future expectations which are described under projected years.

I've used a chord chart to suggest relationships among each of the subjects. It is fair to say that many of these subject matters are related to each other
and some may even have dependencies on others.
